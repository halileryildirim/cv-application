# CV-Application

CV Application built with HTML CSS Javascript and React.js. Users can add and edit personal info, work experiences and education information.

Lesson Learned:

State in react.js is asynchronous so instead of having states for every single input, it can be handled by having them as an object and use [name : value] pairs since name variables are used in input elements.
